    <h2 style="color:red"> Bio </h2>
	<p style="color:red">Hey, My name is Patrick Sapp, and I live in Hawkinsville, Georgia, which is about two and half hours away from where I live now in Athens, Georgia. I am a sophomore and currently attend the University of Georgia majoring in intended Business Management with an Emphasis in Operations/Supply Chain Management. 
	I have 2 brothers who are currently ages 15 and 11. I went to a small high school in Perry, Georgia which usually graduates around 45 people each year. 
	</p>
	<p style="color:red">Going to the University of Georgia has been my dream school ever since I was little. My father and two of my grandparents attended the University of Georgia so that began my strong desire to attend this special University.
	I grew up hearing stories from them about how much fun living in Athens, Georgia was. When I was introduced to UGA football at an early age my passion to ensure that I tried my hardest so that 
	I could get accepted into UGA began then.</p>
	<p style="color:red">Today I still maintain a great passion for UGA football. I read all the stats about all the players and memorize them all. Every year I look forward to the fall days in Athens where my fiends and I can 
		be between the hedges to cheer on the Dawgs. There is nothing else better to me to be able to wake up on Saturdays and realize that UGA plays today and that I will get another opportunity to be in Sanford Stadium as a UGA student.</p>
